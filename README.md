# **CRYPTOVERSE**

## Hello there üëã!! Thanks for cheaking out this project.

CRYPTOVERSE is all about the news of crypt-currencies. Users can get all the useful information about crypts. Such as - name , price, rank, daily exchanges. Users can get detail information about specific crypts with a simple click. A line chart is used for users to show about the growth of crypts over the years.

## How to run the projects

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can download the zip file from github. After downloading the zip file go to the downloaded folder and extract the folder. select the extracted folder and open your terminal.
Then run the command

### `npm install` or `npm i` to download the necessary dependencies for the project.

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Built With

- React
- React router to navigate through pages
- React hooks
- React chartjs for using line chart
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- axios to fetch data from external API
- Ant Design to built the user interface
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media query

## What I learned

- How to break-down enitre application in smaller components.

- Reuse the components when needed.

- Got a good understanding about how to use react-router to navigate through different pages of the application.

- Got a basic idea about Redux Toolkit and how it uses a single store to contain global state of the application.

- how to fetch data from external api asynchronously

- how to use ant design (React UI library) to build user interfaces easily and more elegantly

- How to use search function to show specific data, when user search for it.

- Got a good practice with website layout with a realistic design.

- Got a good practice with media query for responsive layout.

## Useful resources

- checkout [CSS TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) page to get a deep understanding about how flexbox work.

- You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
